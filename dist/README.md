## Doist Todo List

A task management application. The primary objectives of this project was to really get in some good practice with all recently acquired knowledge of object handeling and code organization in Javascript, and to keep SOLID principles at the forefront of thought, especially the single responsibility principle.

It didn't matter much for the purposes of this project which features I chose to implement. I was most intrigued to work on the sort functions and expanding/collapsing views, so time ran out before even implementing the obvious 'edit task' feature. Luckily this is the sort of project that will be great to revisit time and again.


# Reflections

I re-designed my objects and modules several times throughout this project, trying to find a system I liked for separating DOM logic and application logic, and determining in some instances (like exiting out of a menu or modal after some action is performed), what should go where. Where I landed with this project is a definite improvement from past projects, but should remain a focus into the future.
